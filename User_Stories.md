As a recon team member, I want to be able to clear a building or room silently without risking my team member or my life
As a military officer, I want the RC car to have a stable connection, so that we can limit the risks of a dangerous operation
As a troop without piloting or video game experience, I want the RC car to be controlled using a VR glove, so that I can learn quickly through natural motions
As a field-based operator, I want the RC car to be very quiet if not silent, so that I am not exposed though noise when the car is scouting
As a task force leader, I want the car to be able to cover rough terrain, so that I can use it in many different environments
