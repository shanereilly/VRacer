## About
VRacer is a remote-controlled vehicle that is manipulated with the use of a virtual reality (VR) glove. 

## Motivation
Controlling a vehicle remotely is often awkward and clunky. Traditional joystick-based methods of control involve a steep learning curve. The use of a VR glove will allow the user to control the vehicle in a far more precise and intuitive fashion. In addition, the glove will provide haptic feedback to the user, resulting in a more immersive experience.
