## Project Abstract
VR is a modern technology with a heap of untapped potential. It has been implemented heavily in the medical and entertainment sectors but one place where it has been relatively neglected is the military field. We saw an opening in one particular place that aligned with our groups’ interest, and that was the potential that VR had in coordination with remote vehicles. Remote vehicles are a relatively recent development in military operations, but we believe that its pairing with VR would be particularly useful for reconnaissance and intelligence. Of course, before becoming advanced enough to be used in the military, it must be useful in a practical sense. We aim to build a sort of prototype for a connection between a VR glove and a remote control car. The car will be controlled by hand gestures that will enable the user to take complete control of the car and its movements. We believe that this control scheme will allow for more fluid movement and intuitive control of the car. Further modifications to the design would be a camera attached to the car that allows the user to see the surroundings of the car in real time, and implementing a headset connection with the camera. We believe that this technology can be greatly beneficial in a variety of sectors, not limited to military.

## Project Description
Create a RC car that is controlled by VR hand gloves
The goal is to be able to control the car through hand gestures (forward, backward, turn)
If the goal is met before the deadline, further additions can be added, such as building a 360 degree camera and linking the glove with a VR headset

## User Stories and Design Diagrams
### User Stories 
- As a recon team member, I want to be able to clear a building or room silently without risking my team member or my life
- As a military officer, I want the RC car to have a stable connection, so that we can limit the risks of a dangerous operation
- As a troop without piloting or video game experience, I want the RC car to be controlled using a VR glove, so that I can learn quickly through natural motions
- As a field-based operator, I want the RC car to be very quiet if not silent, so that I am not exposed though noise when the car is scouting
- As a task force leader, I want the car to be able to cover rough terrain, so that I can use it in many different environments

### Hao Truong
For senior design project, me and my team decided to make a RC car that we can
controlled through VR hand gloves. Instead of using joystick on the usual controller, we can use
hand gestures to control the car. Further along the road, we want to be able to build a 360 camera
on the car and link it to VR headset. This will allow user to see what is in front of the car. As
computer science major, I mostly learn about algorithm and data structures of a computer. I want
to have a project that challenge me and more hand-on than learning it through books.
I learned about operating system, data structures, algorithms to write better code. It was
great to learn about how computer work. But I did not get to do a lot of practice or any project
that have a real-life value. I think not a lot of what I learned during my first three years is useful
for me to find a job at entry level. The last two years are better because I had a chance to pick
what class I want to take as elective. Most of the elective classes for 4th and 5th year requires
more hand-on and critical thinking. I think it is very useful. This project will be a good
opportunity for me to learn more about new technologies that I did not get to learn during many
classes I have taken.
I did all my co-ops at Fox Sports Cincinnati. At the first three co-op semesters, I worked
mostly with designing test cases for Fox Sports website. I think this will help a lot during testing
the project. I learned more about edge cases and small details that would affect user experience. I
spent my last two co-ops as software developer for backend team who supports data for Fox
Sports front end. I learned a lot about writing better, cleaner code. Since I will be working with
my teammates for the project, I think it is a good practice to keep the code base clean and easy to
read.
I think this project will be very interesting to work on because it is challenging to do. If
we can control a RC car with a hand gesture, that would open up many applications. It would be
a nice entertaining device. Moreover, we can use the same technology to design special vehicle
for emergency where we will able to reach many location where we could not reach before. I am
excited to work on this project, because I have never done development on VR. So I think it will
be a great experience.
My role in the project would be heavily focused on making connection between the RC
car and VR hand gloves. Our first approach is using Bluetooth, it would work great at close
range but would not work if the car goes out of range. We are planning on using maybe a Wi-Fi
hotspot, which could provide a better range but the tradeoff is higher latency. If I can create a
way to connect them together, I think I would do a good job at that point.
